I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct configuration and the classes seemed to be defined properly, but they had no visual effect.  After checking my CSS file, I noticed that a particular class was being overridden by a more specific class defined later in my stylesheet. This caused the intended Tailwind class to be ignored.
